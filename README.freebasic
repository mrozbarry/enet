You'll want to compile this with mingw or gcc to get it running with FreeBASIC.  I used Code::Blocks to import the
MSVC project, and build libenet.a which works fine.  I may end up converting the project into CMake, which may add
some extra simplicity to the enet project in general.

I translated the headers with the help from dkl and fbfrog ( https://github.com/dkl/fbfrog ).

Any help translating this would be awesome!
